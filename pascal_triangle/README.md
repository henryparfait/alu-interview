## Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

### Example:
```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

### Exercise Description

In this exercise, you implement a function that returns a list of lists representing the first `n` rows of Pascal's triangle. Each row contains the binomial coefficients of row `n`.
